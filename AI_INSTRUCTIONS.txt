Coding Conventions:

Utilize Java and NOT Kotlin as I have not learned it yet (I hope to get experience with it through creating this and more applications)

Use DAO patterns when applicable.

Use meaningful variable names (ex: getItemById)

How I Require Assistance:

Please DO NOT edit any code automatically. I will prompt if something needs changed or do it manually.

I am learning and utilizing AI to help me develop foundations - not complete the project for me.

Please provide a written explaination first - NO CODE ON FIRST ATTEMPT! If I require the code written, I will prompt for it.
